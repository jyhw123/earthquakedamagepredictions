# Earthquake Damage Predictions
This dataset contains information pertaining to buildings that were damaged in the 2015 Gorkha Earthquake in Nepal. Using the features provided such as their building location, construction material of the housing and purpose of housing, we intend to gain a better understanding of the type of data that would be useful in helping us to predict the level of damage to buildings, create a model from the data to predict the buildings that are more susceptible, and finally come up with a guideline regarding the best way buildings can become less prone to damage during an Earthquake.

Models used included neural networks using the Keras libary, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

This was a project carried out in a group for a university data science and AI course. An A+ grade was achieved.
